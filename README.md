This GitHub directory contains all the necessary files and code to complete my Project One case study for Beer and Breweries.

The following files are named this way for you to find:

Project.html = the KNITR output for the .RMD code
Project.RMD = RAW R Code for the Project One
Project One - Burk.pptx = PowerPoint presentation used in the video
Project Link to GitHub.dox = MS Word document turned in to 2DS for you to make it here and YouTube video
PeerEvalForm - Project One part 2 - Carolson.docx = peer review 2nd half.  Should be same as first half, no problems.
README.md = this file

Beers.csv = beer file
Breweries.csv = breweries file
StateData.csv = breweries by state count
nona.csv = no N/A's data file from merging beers.csv and breweries.csv file plus MICE
